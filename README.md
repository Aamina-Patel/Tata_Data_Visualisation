# Tata_Data_Visualisation

## About this Project
The first task was to prepare questions a CEO and CMO might ask about the online retail dataset. Task 2 was a quiz where I had to choose the most suitable visualisation for the questions. Task 3 was where I was able to take the dataset into Power BI and start making 4 visualisations for the CEO and CMO. The fourth and final task I sent in a video of me presenting the data.

## My Approach  
- Transformed the data in Power Query e.g. changing format of the Customer ID column
- Added a new column and wrote a formula to calculate revenue
- I created 4 visualisation and applied the necessary filters
